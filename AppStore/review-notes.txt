When prompted for VM API details on first launch, use the following information:

Server name: anything
API Key: <todo>
API Hash: <todo>

These credentials will allow you to view and manage a server (tesla.cdzombak.net) which is provisioned for testing and is not in production. It may be rebooted, etc. at will.
